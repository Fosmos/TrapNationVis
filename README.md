## Installation (Simple Method)
Install Rainmeter, which can be found at: https://www.rainmeter.net/
* To be safe, maybe download the final instead of the beta

Download the .rmskin file in the release tab
* https://github.com/Fosmos/TrapNationVis/releases

Once downloaded, double-click to run it
* This should add the necessary files and plugins to your system that rainmeter will run

Next open Rainmeter
* It should be one of the tray icons if it's running already

In Rainmeter locate the TrapNation folder
* Hopefully that's easy enough to do ðŸ˜…

Then Double click the .ini file
The Visualizer should show up on your desktop
